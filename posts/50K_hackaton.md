## 🤌 PACE is a hackathon project?

# 🎙️ How it works?

Podcasts are usually long-form audio content. They could contain many interesting topics, but you may be interested in only one or some of them.

**PACE** got you covered!
- 🔈 **Speech Processing**: Generate chapters from audio tracks
- 📃 **NLP**: Search for episodes or chapters using natural language
- 🎨 **Computer Vision**: Generate artwork for chapters using text-to-image models
- 💻 **Web**: Flask + Elasticsearch to build a web app
