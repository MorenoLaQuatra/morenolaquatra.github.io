	abstract = {Timeline summarization aims at presenting long news stories in a compact manner. State-of-the-art approaches first select the most relevant dates from the original event timeline then produce per-date news summaries. Date selection is driven by either per-date news content or date-level references. When coping with complex event data, characterized by inherent news flow redundancy, this pipeline may encounter relevant issues in both date selection and summarization due to a limited use of news content in date selection and no use of high-level temporal references (e.g., the past month). This paper proposes a paradigm shift in timeline summarization aimed at overcoming the above issues. It presents a new approach, namely Summarize Date First, which focuses on first generating date-level summaries then selecting the most relevant dates on top of summarized knowledge. In the latter stage, it performs date aggregations to consider high-level temporal references as well. The proposed pipeline also supports frequent incremental timeline updates more efficiently than previous approaches. We tested our unsupervised approach both on existing benchmark datasets and on a newly proposed benchmark dataset describing the COVID-19 news timeline. The achieved results were superior to state-of-the-art unsupervised methods and competitive against supervised ones.},

  abstract = {Mosquitoes are a major global health problem. They are responsible for the transmission of diseases and can have a large impact on local economies. Monitoring mosquitoes is therefore helpful in preventing the outbreak of mosquito-borne diseases. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven approach that leverages Transformer-based models for the identification of mosquitoes in audio recordings. The task aims at detecting the time intervals corresponding to the acoustic mosquito events in an audio signal. We formulate the problem as a sequence tagging task and train a Transformer-based model using a real-world dataset collecting mosquito recordings. By leveraging the sequential nature of mosquito recordings, we formulate the training objective so that the input recordings do not require fine-grained annotations. We show that our approach is able to outperform baseline methods using standard evaluation metrics, albeit suffering from unexpectedly high false negatives detection rates. In view of the achieved results, we propose future directions for the design of more effective mosquito detection models.},

  abstract = {Recognizing emotions in non-verbal audio tracks requires a deep understanding of their underlying features. Traditional classifiers relying on excitation, prosodic, and vocal traction features are not always capable of effectively generalizing across speakers' genders. In the ComParE 2022 vocalisation sub-challenge we explore the use of a Transformer architecture trained on contrastive audio examples. We leverage augmented data to learn robust non-verbal emotion classifiers. We also investigate the impact of different audio transformations, including neural voice conversion, on the classifier capability to generalize across speakers' genders. The empirical findings indicate that neural voice conversion is beneficial in the pretraining phase, yielding an improved model generality, whereas is harmful at the finetuning stage as hinders model specialization for the task of non-verbal emotion recognition.},

  abstract = {Recognizing human emotions from videos requires a deep understanding of the underlying multimodal sources, including images, audio, and text. Since the input data sources are highly variable across different modality combinations, leveraging multiple modalities often requires ad hoc fusion networks. To predict the emotional arousal of a person reacting to a given video clip we present ViPER, a multimodal architecture leveraging a modality-agnostic transformer based model to combine video frames, audio recordings, and textual annotations. Specifically, it relies on a modality-agnostic late fusion network which makes ViPER easily adaptable to different modalities. The experiments carried out on the Hume-Reaction datasets of the MuSe-Reaction challenge confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},
